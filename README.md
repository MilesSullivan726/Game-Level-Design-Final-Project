# Game-Level-Design-Final-Project
3D Platformer Level for Game Level Design

This level was our final project in my Game Level Design class, with it being a group project where we were tasked with making a third person platformer level. Each groupmate had to design and build a section of the level, including a map layout and short write up to plan the levels out. We were required to utilize Unreal Engine's level streaming capabilities to seamlessly stream each groupmates level in and out of the game depending on the player's current location.

Note: Collision on checkpoints is still bugged when pulling to a new machine and needs to be manually removed. Collision on the starter kit rock asset is also not saving and has to be manually added when the project is put on a new machine.
